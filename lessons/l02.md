## 02.01 hello C

You can find a simple [hello-world in C](../languages/cpp/examples/hello-world.c). That is a simple C program in a file. What is a file?

### 02.01.01 detour: unix, file, kernel, and shell

There is a famous saying, everything in unix is a file or a process.

Check out [this introduction to unix](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html).

### 02.02.02 hello-world.c

Open a terminl in Mac.

```
$ cat hello-world.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, World!\n");

  return 0;
}
$ xxd hello-world.c

00000040: 2072 6574 7572 6e20 303b 0a7d 0a          return 0;.}.
$ gcc hello-world.c -o hello
$ ./hello
Hello, World!

To build a C program, you need a text editor to write the code. You need the C compiler in place. In Mac, usually you need to install ```Xcode Command Line Tools```. To check if your Mac has it installed, use the following.

```
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin21.2.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin
```

An executable file is different from a text file. The example is that c-file is a text file. The result after compilation and linking, is an executable. Each OS has its differemy format for the executable file.

Explore  more information about [the C standard libraries](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/header).

## 02.02 How to write a program in C?

A program in C has some format requirements:

* the comment has two formats:
  * one-line comment starts with a ```//``` and ends with a newline
  * multiple-line comment starts with a ```/*``` and ends with a ```*/```, paired
  * comments are meant for developer, the C compiler will ignore them
* each C program must have one main function, only one.
  * ```int main() { return 0; }```
* each function has a return type, name, optional input parameters:
  * ```int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }```
  * ```void test() { int x = add(3, 5); }```
  * function ```test``` does not have a return, thus ```void```.
  * function ```test``` calls function ```add``` with two inputs.
* each statement ends with a ```;```
* to use a function in a standard library, do the following at the start:
  * ```#include <stdio.h>```
  * for example, to use the function ```printf```, which is one function implemented inside the ```stdio``` library for C code
* data types in C program:
  * whenever you declare a variable, you have to specify its type: ```int x;```
  * four data types in C
    * basic: ```int```, ```char```, ```float```, ```double```, ...
    * derived: array: ```char name[10];``` or ```int x[4];```, pointer, structure, union
    * enumeration: enum
    * void: void
* declare the variable before using it
* declare the function before using it

### 02.02.01 Another example

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void sayHello(char *name) {
  printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}

int main() {
  char name[] = "daniel"; // name with [] is an array, inside all char
  sayHello(name); // name is a pointer, pointing to the start address of the array

  char another[] = "Charles"; // another is an array, inside all char
  sayHello(another); 

  return 0;
}
```
 
## 02.03 BF compiler in C

Check out [this code as a BF compiler](../languages/bf/c/brainfuck.c).

```
$ mkdir bf
$ cd bf
$ cat brainfuck.c
$ $ls -la
total 48
drwxr-xr-x  8 wb  staff   256  2 Sep 11:13 .
drwxr-xr-x  6 wb  staff   192  3 Sep 09:38 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 wb  staff   126  2 Sep 11:12 Makefile
-rw-r--r--  1 wb  staff  2532  2 Sep 11:12 brainfuck.c
$ make
```

If it does not build, maybe the Make is not installed in your system.

## 02.04 detour: git and its commands

Git is a revision control system for code. Set it up, learn it and use it.
