# crash courses of computers at your pace

Computer is a magic tool and a great helper. This introduction is trying to show its great magic. Use computer to create better computers. Use one tool to make another better one. The hope is that you could become a super user with deeper understanding of the computer internals, its architecture, its languages, its programs, its operating systems, and its networking protocols.

- [ ] languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript
- [ ] environments: macOS, browsers, command-line
- [ ] code structures
- [ ] hardware structures
- [ ] discrete math

The key questions to answer here are what a computer is and how to code it.

The content is based around UC Berkley CS61A, CS61B, CS61C, and CS70. To get there, crash courses on C, C++, Python, and JavaScript are required. So the initial approach is through the perspective of languages. Then the mental model of programming, and the worldview of the computer.
