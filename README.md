# Crashes: crash courses of computers at your pace

Computer is a magic tool and a great helper. This introduction is trying to show its great magic, that is, use a computer to create better computers. The hope is that you could become a super user with deeper understanding of the computer internals, its architecture, its languages, its programs, its operating systems, its networking protocols and many many utilities..

- [ ] languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript
- [ ] environments: macOS, browsers, command-line
- [ ] code structures
- [ ] hardware structures
- [ ] discrete math

The key questions to answer here are **what a computer is** and **how to code it**.

This content is based around UC Berkeley CS61A, CS61B, CS61C, and CS70. To get there, short intros on C, C++, Python, and JavaScript are required. So the initial approach is through the perspective of programming languages. Then the mental model of programming, and the worldview of the computer.

## Steps to crashes

For Windows user, you may see the blue screen of death from time to time. For Linux user, you may see the kernel panic. Both are the crashes when your computer cannot continue its task. Now your rescue is the power button.

For a starter, your code may go crazy. The ultimate rescue is still the power button. For a browser, you could just shut down the program or the application. For a terminal, the combo buttons of ```CTRL``` and ```C``` is another way. It is handy to know the usual ways to recover from code errors or computer crashes, big or small.

To start this, let's start with terminal, replit, and browser.

### Step 0x00: hello computer

* Goal: use several tools, terminal, browser, and replit.
* Goal: write code with [Code IDE] or simple text editors.
* Goal: google hello-world code in C, JavaScript, and Python.
* Goal: setup the toolchain, compile the C code, and run the hello-world.

Read the hello world in [Brainfuck](https://github.com/un01s/crashes/blob/main/languages/bf/NOTES.md). Then do it in JavaScript in a browser. Do it with [replit](https://replit.com) in python.

As an exercise, write the code in Brainfuck to output your first name.
